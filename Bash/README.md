# Important points
- shebang: #!/bin/bash. This is honoured by operating system if script is executed by itself like `./myscript.sh`
- if a variable is passed like this `ENV_VAR=value executable param1 param2` then it is defined for the period of that command execution only.
- when we defined a env variable using `export` then it is pass to all sub or child process called from that environment



# Variables
```bash
# you can not have spaces before and after the = sign.
AGE=25
echo $AGE
# OR
echo ${AGE}		# good practice standard

readonly AGE		# marks the variable as readonly
unset AGE

func() {
	local AGE=25		# local variable (by default variables are global)
}
```

if parameter are passed to the command like this `./myscript.sh para1 para2!` then they can be referenced like by $\<parameter no\>
- $1: for first parameter
- $2: for second parameter
- $@: for all parameter
- $0: reference the script itself (can be used to self destruct by `rm -f $0` in the script)

# take input with 'read'
`-p` is use for prompt msg
`-r` disable escape backslash
`-s` Does not echo user's input
`-t` timeout in seconds

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "What is your name? " name
echo "Hi there $name"
echo "Welcome to DevDojo!"
```


| Variable Type    | Syntax              | Description                                          |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Array            | declare -a variable | declare an indexedarray variable that stores strings |
| Associated Array | declare -A variable | Associated Array (key value pair)                                     |
| Integer          | declare -i variable | numeric value to store in variable                   |
| Readonly         | declare -r variable | readonly variable, cannot be changed or unset        |
| Export           | declare -x variable | export the variable and used by all child process    |


`printenv` or `env` for getting environment variables. Variables are case sensitive

# Special Characters
#### Wildcards
   - `?` single character
   - `*` mulitiple character
   - `[]` character set

#### Command seperator
   - `;` executes each even if previous one fails
   - `&&` stops if previous one fails

#### Background Process
   - `command &` executes the command in background and return the process ID

#### Input redirection
   - To take file as input through stream use left-angle bracket `<`
   - ex: `sort < words.txt`

#### Output redirection
   - Use the right-angle bracket `>` to redirect the output from a command (typically, into a file);
   - ex: `ls > files.txt`
   - use digit 2 to redirect errors. `2>/dev/null` directs error to null

#### Pipe
   - `|` chains commands together. It takes the output from one command and feeds it to the next as input.

> To use special character as it is use single quotes arround them or use backslash
> <br>example: `echo 'Today is $(date)'`
> <br>example: `echo "Today is \$(date)"`


# Comments
```bash
# single line

:'
multiline1
multiline2
'
```

# Array
```bash
array=(one two three)
# in case of array you have to use curly braces
echo ${array[0]}	# first index
echo ${array[-1]}	# last index
array[key1]=one		# for associated or key-vaule type
echo ${array:0:2}	# slicing, 0 inclusive, 2 exclusive
echo ${array::5}	# slicing, defaults to 0, 5 exclusive
echo ${array:3}		# slicing, start from index 3 to end

echo {1..5}
# Outputs to {1 2 3 4 5}


# for loop on array
nums=(1 3 12)
for i in "${nums[@]}"
do
  echo "$i"
done

${array[@]}		Get All elements
${array[*]}		Get All elements
${!array[!]}	Get All indexes
${#array[!]}	Array length
${#array[@]}	Array length
```

# Conditionals

- `[condition]` : file string operation
- `[[condition]]` : combining multiple conditions and handling regex pattern
- `((condition))` : for arithmatic operation

> - conditon is an expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`
> - Space is required before and after `[` and `]`
> - A semicolon before then is required

```bash
# True if file exists. (deprecated)
[[ -a ${file} ]]

# True if file exists.
# preferred in modern scripts
[[ -e ${file} ]]

# True if file exists and is a block special file.
[[ -b ${file} ]]

# True if file exists and is a character special file.
[[ -c ${file} ]]

# True if file exists and is a directory.
[[ -d ${file} ]]

# True if file exists and is a regular file.
[[ -f ${file} ]]

# True if file exists and is a symbolic link.
[[ -h ${file} ]]
# True if file exists and is a symbolic link.
[[ -L ${file} ]]

# True if file exists and is readable.
[[ -r ${file} ]]

# True if file exists and has a size greater than zero.
[[ -s ${file} ]]

# True if file exists and is writable.
[[ -w ${file} ]]

# True if file exists and is executable.
[[ -x ${file} ]]

# True if the shell variable varname is set (has been assigned a value).
[[ -v ${varname} ]]

# True if the length of the string is zero.
[[ -z ${string} ]]

# True if the length of the string is non-zero.
[[ -n ${string} ]]

# String comparison true if equal
[[ ${string1} == ${string2} ]]
# True if the strings are not equal.
[[ ${string1} != ${string2} ]]
# True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically.
[[ ${string1} < ${string2} ]]
# True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.
[[ ${string1} > ${string2} ]]

# Number comparison
[[ ${arg1} -eq ${arg2} ]]  # ==
[[ ${arg1} -ne ${arg2} ]]  # !=
[[ ${arg1} -lt ${arg2} ]]  # <
[[ ${arg1} -le ${arg2} ]]  # <=
[[ ${arg1} -gt ${arg2} ]]  # >
[[ ${arg1} -ge ${arg2} ]]  # >=

# AND / OR
[[ test_case_1 ]] && [[ test_case_2 ]] # And
[[ test_case_1 ]] || [[ test_case_2 ]] # Or

# returns true if the command was successful without any errors
[[ $? -eq 0 ]]
# returns true if the command was not successful or had errors
[[ $? -gt 0 ]]


```
> `$?` stores the last executed command reuslt status like 0 for successful execution and greater than 0 for some error

## if elif else
```bash
if [[ condition1 ]]; then
	# true code
elif condition2
then
	# condition1 is false and condition2 is true
else
	# none of above condition are true
fi
```

example1: check your current UserID and would not allow you to run the script as the root user
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if (( $EUID == 0 )); then
 echo "Please do not run as root"
 exit
fi

```

## case
```bash
case $some_variable in
 pattern_1)		# ) is important at the end
 commands
 ;;				# ;; to end the block
 pattern_2| pattern_3)		# | to separate multiple cases
 commands
 ;;
 *)				# default case start
 default commands
 ;;
esac

```

# Loops
## for
```bash
for element in ${list}
# ex for element in 1 2 3 4 5
do
	echo $element
done

# index loop
for (( assignment; condition; iteration )); do
	# code block
done

for ((i=0; i<5; i++)); do
	echo $i
done
```

## while
```bash
while [ condition ]; do
	# code block
done

i=0
while [[ i -lt 100 ]]; do
	echo "$i"
	i=$((i+1))
done
```

example1:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
counter=1
while [[ $counter -le 10 ]]
do
 echo $counter
 ((counter++))
done
```

## until
The difference between `until` and `while` loops is that the `until` loop will run the commands within the loop until the condition becomes `true`
```bash
until [[ your_condition ]]
do
 your_commands
done
```

## `continue` and `break`
syntax: `continue [n]` and `break[n]`
> here the [n] argument is optional and can be greater than or equal to 1. When [n] is given, the n-th enclosing loop is affected.

> For two nested loop, if continue 2 is used then instead of resuming inner loop it will go to outer loop

```bash
until [[ condition until true ]]
do
	while [[ condition ]]
	do
		# do something
		continue 2
	done
done
```

# Function
```bash
function function_name() {
 your_commands
}
# OR
function_name() {
 your_commands
}

```
- `function` keyword is optional
- You should not add the parenthesis when you call the function

Example1:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

#######################################
# Description: Hello function
# Globals:
# None
# Arguments:
# Single input argument
# Outputs:
# Value of input argument
# Returns:
# 0 if successful, non-zero on error.
#######################################
function hello() {
 echo "Hello $1!"
}
hello DevDojo
```
